## I created this document as a branch of main. What I am doing here will nt effect the Main branch. After I have done my work i-e build a new feature. I can simply merge it with my Main Branch.


* To Create a new branch use git branch -c <-Branch name->
* To check which branch are you in, use git branch
* The branch is located created in your system but github has no idea about it. So to push it to Github we will use git push origin HEAD command to push our new branch remotely.
