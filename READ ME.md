# Muhammad Abbas TASK 2 Detailed Git Operations

# 1. Initialize a Git Repository
In version control, initialization creates a new, **empty repository**.
Version control, also known as source control, is the process of managing and tracking changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time

# 2. Add Files & Commit
As writing this documentation, I will stage this repo using ==git add.== command

# 3. Difference between Forking and Cloning a Repository

## Fork & Clone: Understanding the Basics

|   | Fork | Clone |
|---|------|-------|
| **Definition** | Forking is done on the GitHub Account | Cloning is done using Git |
| **Outcome** | Forking creates a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account | Cloning creates a copy of the original repository on our local machine |
| **Merge Changes** | Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request | Changes made to the cloned repository cannot be merged with the original repository unless you are the collaborator or the owner of the repository |
| **Nature** | Forking is a concept | Cloning is a process |
| **Execution** | Forking contains a separate copy of the repository, and there is no command involved | Cloning is done through the command 'git clone,' and it is a process of receiving all the code files to the local machine |


Remember:
- **Forking:** Creating a personal copy on your GitHub account.
- **Cloning:** Bringing a copy of the repository to your local machine.
