#Difference between Forking and Cloning a Repository

## Fork & Clone: Understanding the Basics

|   | Fork | Clone |
|---|------|-------|
| **Definition** | Forking is done on the GitHub Account | Cloning is done using Git |
| **Outcome** | Forking creates a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account | Cloning creates a copy of the original repository on our local machine |
| **Merge Changes** | Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request | Changes made to the cloned repository cannot be merged with the original repository unless you are the collaborator or the owner of the repository |
| **Nature** | Forking is a concept | Cloning is a process |
| **Execution** | Forking contains a separate copy of the repository, and there is no command involved | Cloning is done through the command 'git clone,' and it is a process of receiving all the code files to the local machine |


Remember:
- **Forking:** Creating a personal copy on your GitHub account.
- **Cloning:** Bringing a copy of the repository to your local machine.
