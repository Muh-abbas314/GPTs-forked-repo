#Difference between Forking and Cloning a Repository

Fork          | Clone
------------- | -------------
* Forking is done on the GitHub Account  | * Cloning is done using Git
* Forking a repo creates a copy of original repo on your Github Accout  | * Cloning a repo creates a copy of the original repo on our local machine
* Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request | * Changes made to the cloned repository cannot be merged with the original repository unless you are the collaborator or the owner of the repository
* Forking is just containing a separate copy of the repository and there is no command involved | * Cloning is done through the command ‘git clone‘ and it is a process of receiving all the code files to the local machine
